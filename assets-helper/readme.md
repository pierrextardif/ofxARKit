Assets Helper
====

This is a simple python script meant to help you generate a complete assets 
catalog of images for image recognition. 


The goal is to completely look through a folder of images, take measurements and do the necessary conversions from pixels to inches, and finally, spit out a complete assets catalog that ARKit can take advantage of. 

Note that, this is meant for folks who may want to recognize a large number of images. It's highly likely it won't be worthwhile for anyone who may only have a couple of images that they need to recognize for their app. 


Installation 
=====
It's written in Python - so chances are pretty good you already have that running on your system. So far it should work with Python 3+ at least, it may work with Python 2+ as well. 


Use
====
Run this script from the root of your project folder. 

To-dos
====
* need to figure out dimensions still but should be able to finaly build paths and files correctly.
