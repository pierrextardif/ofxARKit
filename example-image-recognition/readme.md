Example showing new 11.3 feature: Image Recognition. Uses images from Apple's example, which is found [here](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/6d6f149c5f/RecognizingImagesInAnARExperience.zip)

Setting up new images:
* Create a new 'Asset Catalog' 
* File-> New File or command+n
* Scroll down to Asset Catalog
* Name it something sensible
* Create an AR resource group
* Click on the catalog in Xcode
* Click the "+" icon at the bottom, and select 'AR Resource Group'
* Add images to your Resource Group
* Drag images into the specified area, either from within Xcode or from Finder
* Specify the real-life physical dimensions of your images 
* Click on each image in your Resource Group

# Potential gotchas
* Not sure if it's a code or device issue but there may be a slight delay before an image is recognized.
