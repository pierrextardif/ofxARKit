I'm not planning on being a stickler for how one should contribute to this. I still have a lot to learn, not just about AR but
OpenGL and C++ as well(My day job is sadly spent in web-land and not the fun kind of web haha). 

Basically as the readme says - if things don't break, 
I'll probably accept it. That being said just so things don't get out of hand :


# General rules

* no huge deviations from how the code is currently structured. For example, don't pack all the new functionality you wanna add into 
the `ARProcessor` class. Instead, seperate it outside into it's own class so whatever new functionality you want to add can 
also be used on it's own.

* remember to file PRs against the `develop` branch, master is intended for solid and well-tested(well, relatively well tested haha) code. 


That's really it for now, this'll get updated as things change.
