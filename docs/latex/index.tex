open\+Frameworks + A\+R\+Kit

\subsection*{A Basic toolkit for an I\+OS app with A\+R\+Kit support.}

This is an open\+Frameworks addon that provides some helper classes for working within A\+R\+Kit.

\section*{Installation and project setup}

{\bfseries First}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \href{https://developer.apple.com/xcode/}{\tt get Xcode}
\item \href{https://www.apple.com/ios}{\tt get the latest version of i\+OS}
\end{DoxyItemize}

{\bfseries then}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Download open\+Frameworks \href{https://openframeworks.cc/versions/v0.10.0/of_v0.10.0_ios_release.zip}{\tt here}
\item clone this repo into your addons folder
\item start a new project with the project generator.
\end{DoxyItemize}

{\bfseries After you\textquotesingle{}ve opened up the project file}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item add a permission setting in your {\ttfamily ofx\+I\+O\+S-\/\+Info.\+plist} file. See Permissions below.
\item set the project target for I\+OS 11 / 12
\item you may need to do two things with the {\ttfamily Shader.\+metal} file
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item add it to the compiled sources
\item make sure to set the file designation back to it\textquotesingle{}s default(for some reason it\textquotesingle{}s treated as \char`\"{}\+Data\char`\"{} in the project\+Generator generated project)
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}

Note that you may have to repeat these steps if you make any changes to your project via the generator.

\section*{Initializing A\+R\+Kit}

To get started, you need to initialize the A\+R\+Kit framework. This can be done a couple of different ways. ofx\+A\+R\+Kit provides a helper api to quickly initialize a session without too much fuss.

{\bfseries Session\+Setup} 
\begin{DoxyCode}
\{c++\}
    ofxARKit::core::SFormat format;
    format.enablePlaneTracking().enableLighting();
    auto session = ARCore::generateNewSession(format);
\end{DoxyCode}


the {\ttfamily S\+Format} object is a way to enable various features of A\+R\+Kit in a more straightforward manner. Passing an instance of an {\ttfamily S\+Format} object to {\ttfamily A\+R\+Core\+::generate\+New\+Session} will automatically generate a new {\ttfamily A\+R\+Session} object, while ensuring the specified features are useable on your device.

You can of course, write things by hand which isn\textquotesingle{}t too difficult either.
